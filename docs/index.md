EEDC Encoder Project
Welcome to the EEDC Encoder project repository. This project focuses on implementing an Enhanced Error Detection and Correction (EEDC) Encoder to reduce redundancy bits in digital communication systems, addressing the limitations of traditional methods like Hamming Code and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC).
Project Overview

Problem: In digital communication, adding redundancy bits for error detection increases transmission delay, which can lead to issues like increased latency, degraded user experience, and reduced throughput.
Solution: The EEDC algorithm combines the strengths of Hamming Code and CRC while minimizing the number of redundancy bits, thereby reducing transmission delay.
Implementation: The project includes Verilog implementations of Hamming, CRC, and EEDC encoders, along with their test benches and simulation results.
